# Netkan

Self-hosted .netkan files for inflation by CKAN's robot.

The "ksp_version" field should be changed at the same time as a new release is created for any mods using a github "$kref".

To set a range of ksp versions, you can replace the individual "ksp_version" line with a min/max pair, like this:

    "ksp_version_min": "1.1.0",
    "ksp_version_max": "1.1.5",
    
For details of how to make changes to these files, see https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Adding-a-mod-to-the-CKAN and https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/blob/master/Spec.md
